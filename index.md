# Projects

## Exhibitions

The MOTF's exhibitions are the output of multiple Creative Technology groups. The projects are built using a variety of frameworks.

## Systems and Operations

The MOTF's systems are managed using a combination of development operations (DevOps) and facilities management (FM) tools. Yeah that's weird and interesting. :)
